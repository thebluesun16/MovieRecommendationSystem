## 🔍 What's Been Done

**Data Processing** - Used the TMDB 5000 Movies dataset. Extracted and combined features including genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview into a single text representation per movie.

**Similarity Engine** - Applied `CountVectorizer` to convert text features into vectors, then computed **cosine similarity** across all movies to find the closest matches for any given title.

**Deployment** - Built an interactive Streamlit app where users select a movie from a dropdown and get 5 recommended movies with live posters fetched via the TMDB API.
